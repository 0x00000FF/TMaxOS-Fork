@c Notes about embedded man page:
@c This texinfo code contains the necessary info to produce a man page
@c which resembles much the version of xorriso.1 from which this code
@c was originally derived in march 2010.
@c One can produce the man page by applying the following rules:
@c   The first line gets discarded.
@c   Line start "@c man " will become "", the remainder is put out unaltered.
@c   Lines "@*" will be converted to ".br"
@c   "@c man-ignore-lines N"  will discard N following lines.
@c   "@c man-ignore-lines begin" discards all following lines
@c   up to "@c man-ignore-lines end".
@c   Line blocks of "@menu" "@end menu" will be discarded.
@c   "@item word words" becomes "\fBword\fR words".
@c   @b{...}, @command{...}, @dfn{...}, @emph{...}, @strong{...}
@c     get mapped to \fB...\fR .
@c   @abbr{...}, @code{...}, @file{...}, @i{...}, @option{...}, @r{...},
@c     @ref{...}, @samp{...},@var{...}, get mapped to ... .
@c   @ref{...}, @xref{...} get mapped to empty text.
@c   @email{...} gets mapped to <...> .
@c   Mapped {...} content is subject to the rules except {...} mapping.
@c   @minus{} will become "-".
@c   @@ , @{, @} will get stripped of their first @.
@c   Other lines which begin by "@" will be discarded.
@c   In lines not stemming from "@c man", "\" becomes "\\"
@c   "-" which are not preceded by an uneven number of "\" will get
@c     prepended one "\".

@c man .B xorrisofs
@c man [ options ] [-o filename ] pathspec [pathspecs ...]
@c man .br
@c man .SH DESCRIPTION
@c man .PP
@command{xorrisofs}
produces Rock Ridge enhanced ISO 9660 filesystems and add-on sessions to
such filesystems. Optionally it can produce Joliet directory trees too.
@*
@sp 1
@c man .PP
@command{xorrisofs} understands options of program mkisofs from cdrtools by
Joerg Schilling.
Its implementation is part of program xorriso which shares no source
code with cdrtools.

@c man \fBISO 9660, Rock Ridge, Joliet, HFS+:\fR
@c man .br
@cindex ISO 9660, _definition
@cindex ECMA-119, _definition
@strong{ISO 9660}
(aka @strong{ECMA-119}) is a read-only filesystem that is mainly used for
optical media CD, DVD, BD, but may also reside on other storage devices like
disk files, USB sticks or disk partitions. It is widely readable by many
operating systems and by boot facilities of personal computers.
@*
ISO 9660 describes directories and data files by
very restricted filenames with no distinction of upper case and lower case. 
Its metadata do not comply to fundamental POSIX specifications.
@*
@cindex Rock Ridge, _definition
@strong{Rock Ridge}
is the name of a set of additional information which enhance
an ISO 9660 filesystem so that it can represent a POSIX compliant filesystem
with ownership, access permissions, symbolic links, and other attributes.
Rock Ridge allows filenames of up to 255 bytes and paths of up to
1024 bytes.
@*
xorrisofs produces Rock Ridge information by default. It is strongly
discouraged to disable this feature.
@*
@cindex Joliet, _definition
@strong{Joliet} 
is the name of an additional directory tree which provides
filenames up to 64 characters encoded as UTF-16.
A Joliet tree is mainly interesting for reading the ISO image by
operating systems of Microsoft Corporation.
Production of this directory tree may be enabled by option -J.
@*
@cindex ISO 9660:1999, _definition
@strong{ISO 9660:1999}
is the name of an additional directory tree which provides longer
filenames. It allows single file names to have up to 207 characters.
It might be of use with some older computer system boot
facilities which read neither Rock Ridge nor Joliet but
need longer filenames nevertheless.
Production of this directory tree may be enabled by option -iso-level 4.
@*
@cindex HFS+, _definition
@strong{HFS+}
is the name of a filesystem which is normally used for writing and reading
on hard disks and similar devices. It is possible to embed a HFS+ partition
into the emerging ISO 9660 image and to mark it by Apple Partition Map
entries. This interferes with options which copy data into the first 32 KiB
of the ISO image, like -G or -isohybrid-mbr. See option -hfsplus.
@*
The main purpose for having an embedded HFS+ partition is booting of
certain models of Apple computers.

@c man .B Inserting files into the ISO image:
@node Insert, Xorriso, Standards, Top
@chapter Inserting files into the ISO image
@c man .PP
@command{xorrisofs} deals with two kinds of file addresses:
@*
@cindex disk_path, _definition
@strong{disk_path}
is a path to an object in the local filesystem tree.
@*
@cindex iso_rr_path, _definition
@strong{iso_rr_path}
is the Rock Ridge address of a file object in the ISO image. 
If no Rock Ridge information shall be stored in an emerging ISO, then the
names will get mapped to ISO 9660 names of limited length and character set.
@cindex pathspec, _definition
@*
@sp 1
@c man .PP
A program argument is handled as a @strong{pathspec}, if it is not
recognized as original mkisofs option or additional @command{xorrisofs} option.
A pathspec depicts an input file object by a disk_path. 
If option -graft-points is not present, then the behavior depends on the
file type of disk_path. Directories get merged with the /-directory of the
ISO image. Files of other types get copied into the /-directory. 
@*
If -graft-points is present then each pathspec gets split at the first
occurrence of the =-character.
The part before the = is taken as @strong{target}, i.e. the iso_rr_path for
the file object in the ISO image. The part after the first = is taken
as @strong{source}, i.e. the disk_path of the input object.
@*
It is possible to make =-characters part of the iso_rr_path by preceding
them with a \-character. The same must be done for \-characters which
shall be part of the iso_rr_path.
@*
@sp 1
@c man .PP
If the source part of the pathspec leads to a directory, then all files
underneath this directory get inserted into the image, too.
It is possible to exclude particular files from being inserted
by help of option -m.
@*
In case that target already exists, the following rules apply:
Directories and other files may overwrite existing non-directories.
Directories get merged with existing directories.
Non-directories may not overwrite existing directories.

@c man .br
@cindex xorriso, mkisofs emulation
@command{xorrisofs} is actually a command mode of program @strong{xorriso},
which gets entered either by xorriso command "-as mkisofs" or by
starting the program by one of the names "xorrisofs", "mkisofs",
"genisoimage", or "genisofs".
@*
This command mode can be left by argument "@minus{}@minus{}" which leads
to generic xorriso command mode. See @strong{man xorriso} for its description.
@*
@sp 1
@c man .PP
xorriso performs image reading and writing by help of libburn, which is
mainly intended for optical drives, but also operates on all POSIX
file types except directories.
@*
The program messages call any image file a "drive". File types which are not
supported for reading are reported as "blank". The reported free media
space may be quite fictional.
@*
Nevertheless @command{xorrisofs} does not operate directly on optical drives,
but rather forces libburn to regard them as general device files.
So for writing of sequential optical media (CD, DVD-R, DVD+R, BD-R)
one will have to use a burn program. E.g the cdrecord emulation of xorriso.
See EXAMPLES.

@c man .B Image loading:
@node Loading, SetInsert, Options, Options
@section Influencing the behavior of image loading
@c man .PP
The following options control loading of an existing ISO image for the purpose
of preparing a suitable add-on session.
If they are missing then a new image is composed from scratch.
@table @asis
@sp 1
@c man .TP
@item -M disk_path
@kindex -M   set path for loading existing ISO image
@cindex Session, select path, -M, -prev-session, -dev
Set the path from which to load the existing ISO image directory tree
on which to base the upcomming directory tree as add-on session.
The path must lead to a random-access readable file object.
On GNU/Linux: regular data files or block device files.
@*
A special kind of pseudo disk_path has the form "/dev/fd/"number.
It depicts the open file descriptor with the given number, regardless whether
the operating system supports this feature by file nodes in /dev/fd or not.
E.g. /dev/fd/3 is file descriptor 3 which was opened by the program that
later started xorriso.
@c man .TP
@item -prev-session disk_path
@kindex -prev-session   set path for loading existing ISO image
Alias of -M.
@c man .TP
@item -dev disk_path
@kindex -dev   set path for loading existing ISO image
Alias of -M.
@c man .TP
@item -C last_session_start,next_writeable_address
@kindex -C   set load address and write address offset
@cindex Session, set load and write address, -C, -cdrecord-params
Set the 2 KiB block address last_session_start from where to read the
ISO image out of the file given by option -M.
@*
Separated by a comma, set the next_writeable_address to which the
add-on session will finally be written. Decisive is actually the block
address which the intended readers will have to use as superblock address
on the intended medium.
@*
Both values can be inquired from optical media by help of burn programs
and cdrecord option -msinfo. xorriso itself can obtain it in its
cdrecord emulation. Do not let it load the drive, but rather do this manually
or by a program like dd which reads a few bytes. Only then it is sure that
the device driver knows the true readable size of the medium.
@*
@sp 1
  dd if=/dev/... count=1 >/dev/null 2>&1
@*
  values=$(xorriso -as cdrecord dev=/dev/... -msinfo)
@*
  echo $values
@*
@sp 1
Option -C may be used without option -M to create an ISO image from
scratch and prepare it for being finally written to a block address
other than 0. Parameter last_session_start must then be set to 0.
@c man .TP
@item -cdrecord-params last_session_start,next_writeable_address
@kindex -cdrecord-params   set load address and write address offset
Alias of -C.

@c man .TP
@item -path-list disk_path
@kindex -path-list   read pathspecs from disk file
@cindex pathspec, read list of, -path-list
Read pathspecs line-by-line from disk_file and insert the depicted file
objects into the ISO image. If disk_path is "-" then read the pathspecs
from standard input.
@c man .TP
@item @minus{}@minus{}quoted_path_list disk_path
@kindex @minus{}@minus{}quoted_path_list   read pathspecs from disk file
@cindex pathspec, read list of, @minus{}@minus{}quoted_path_list
Like option -path-list but reading quoted words rather than plain lines.
Whitespace outside of quotes will be discarded. On the other hand it is
possible to represent pathspecs which contain newline characters.
@*
The double quotation mark " and the single quotation mark ' can be used to
enclose whitespace and make it part of pathspecs. Each mark
type can enclose the marks of the other type. A trailing backslash \ outside
quotations or an open quotation cause the next input line to be appended.
@c man .TP
@item -f
@kindex -f   follow symbolic links on disk
@cindex Links, follow on disk, -f, -follow-links
@*
Resolve symbolic links on disk rather than storing them as symbolic
links in the ISO image.
@c man .TP
@item -follow-links
@kindex -follow-links   follow symbolic links on disk
Alias of -f.
@c man .TP
@item -graft-points
@kindex -graft-points   enable target=source pathspecs
@cindex pathspec, enable target=source, -graft-points
Enable interpretation of input file pathspecs as combination of iso_rr_path
and disk_path, separated by a =-character.
@c man .TP
@item -m disk_pattern
@kindex -m   exclude disk files from inserting
@cindex Disk files, exclude, -m, -exclude, -x, -old-exclude
Exclude files from being inserted into the image. Silently ignored are
those files of which the disk_path matches the given shell parser pattern.
If no /-character is part of the pattern, then it gets matched against
the leaf name of the disk file.
@*
It is possible to give more than one -m option.
@c man .TP
@item -exclude
@kindex -exclude   exclude disk files from inserting
Alias of -m.
@c man .TP
@item -x
@kindex -x   exclude disk files from inserting
@*
Alias of -m.

Alias of -m.
@c man .TP
@item -exclude-list disk_path
@kindex -exclude-list   exclude disk files from inserting
@cindex Disk files, exclude, -hide-list
Perform -m using each line out of file disk_path as argument disk_pattern.
@c man .TP
@item -z
@kindex -z   enable recognition of zisofs files
@cindex zisofs file, enable recognition, -z, -transparent-compression
@*
Enable recognition and proper processing of zisofs compressed files
as produced by program mkzftree. These files will get equipped with the
necessary meta data so that a Linux kernel will recognize them and
deliver their content in uncompressed form.
@c man .TP
@item -transparent-compression
@kindex -transparent-compression   enable recognition of zisofs files
Alias of -z.
@c man .TP
@item -root iso_rr_path
@kindex -root   redirect ISO root directory
@cindex ISO root directory, redirect, -root
Insert all files under the given iso_rr_path. If option -graft-points is given,
then iso_rr_path is prepended to each target part of a pathspec.
@*
The default for -root is "/".
@c man .TP
@item -old-root iso_rr_path
@kindex -old-root   enable incremental insertion
@cindex Incremental insertion, enable, -old-root
Enable incremental insertion of files into the loaded image.
The effective target and source addresses of given pathspecs get compared
whether the target already exists in the ISO image and is still identical
to the source on disk. Metadata in the ISO image will get adjusted, if they
differ from those on disk.
New files and files with changed content will get newly added.
Target files which do not exist in any of the according pathspec sources
will get removed from the ISO directory tree.
@*
If the effective setting of -root differs from the iso_rr_path given
with -old-root, then the files underneath the -old-root directory get cloned
underneath the -root directory. Cloning happens before file comparison.
@c man .TP
@item @minus{}@minus{}old-root-no-ino
@kindex @minus{}@minus{}old-root-no-ino   disable disk ino with -old-root
@cindex Incremental insertion, disable disk ino, @minus{}@minus{}old-root-no-ino
Disable recording and use of disk inode numbers.
If no disk inode numbers are recorded, then option -old-root will have
to read disk file content and compare it with the MD5 checksum that is
recorded in the ISO image.
@*
With recorded disk inode numbers and with credible ctime and mtime,
it is possible to detect potential changes in the content without actually
reading it.
A loophole remains if multiple different filesystems may get mounted
at the same directory, like it is habit with /mnt.
In this case one has to use option @minus{}@minus{}old-root-devno
or disable the inode number shortcut by @minus{}@minus{}old-root-no-ino.
@c man .TP
@item @minus{}@minus{}old-root-devno
@kindex @minus{}@minus{}old-root-devno   enable disk idevno with -old-root
@cindex Incremental insertion, enable disk devno, @minus{}@minus{}old-root-devno
Enable comparison of recorded device numbers together with recorded
inode numbers. This works only with good old stable device numbers which
get out of fashion, regrettably. If the hard disk has a different
device number after each reboot, then this comparison will see all
files as changed and thus prevent any incremental size saving.
@c man .TP
@item @minus{}@minus{}old-root-no-md5
@kindex @minus{}@minus{}old-root-no-md5   disable MD5 with -old-root
@cindex Incremental insertion, disable MD5, @minus{}@minus{}old-root-no-md5
Disable recording and use of MD5 checksums for data file content.
If neither checksums and nor disk inode numbers are recorded, then
option -old-root will have to read ISO image file content when comparing
it with disk file content.

@c man .TP
@item -o disk_path
@kindex -o   set output file address
@cindex Output file, set address, -o, -output
Set the output file address for the emerging ISO image.
If the address exists as regular file, it will be truncated to length 0
when image production begins. It may not already exist as directory.
If it does not exist yet then its parent directory must exist and
a regular file will get created.
@*
A special kind of pseudo disk_path has the form "/dev/fd/"number.
It depicts the open file descriptor with the given number, regardless whether
the operating system supports this feature by file nodes in /dev/fd or not.
E.g. /dev/fd/4 is file descriptor 4 which was opened by the program that
later started xorriso.
@*
Default is standard output (/dev/fd/1) which may also be set by disk_path "-".
@c man .TP
@item -output disk_path
@kindex -output   set output file address
Alias of -o.
@c man .TP
@item @minus{}@minus{}stdio_sync "on"|"off"|"end"|number
@kindex @minus{}@minus{}stdio_sync   control forced output to disk files
@cindex Forced output, control, @minus{}@minus{}stdio_sync
Set the number of bytes after which to force output to disk
in order to keep the memory from being clogged with lots of
pending data for slow devices. "on" is the same as "16m".
Forced output can be disabled by "off", or be delayed by "end" until all 
data are produced. If a number is chosen, then it must be at least 64k.
@*
The default with xorriso mkisofs emulation is @minus{}@minus{}stdio_sync "off".
@*
xorriso uses an inner fifo buffer with default size 4 MiB. So forcing
the operating system i/o cache to disk does not necessarily block the
simultaneous production of more image content.
@c man .TP
@item @minus{}@minus{}emul-toc
@kindex @minus{}@minus{}emul-toc   enable table-of-content emulation
@cindex Table-of-content, emulation, @minus{}@minus{}emul-toc
Write a second superblock with the first session into random-access
files. If further sessions get appended and the first superblock gets updated,
then the second superblock will not be overwritten. So it is still possible to
mount the first session and to find the start blocks of the further sessions.
@*
The price is 64 KiB extra space consumption. If -partition_offset is non-zero,
then it is 128 KiB plus twice the partition setup.
@c man .TP
@item @minus{}@minus{}no-emul-toc
@kindex @minus{}@minus{}no-emul-toc   no table-of-content emulation
@cindex Table-of-content, emulation off, @minus{}@minus{}no-emul-toc
Do not write a second superblock with the first session into random-access
files.
@*
This is the default.
@c man .TP
@item @minus{}@minus{}sort-weight weight_number iso_rr_path
@kindex @minus{}@minus{}sort-weight   set block address sorting weight
@cindex Block address, set sorting weight, @minus{}@minus{}sort-weight
Attribute a LBA weight number to regular files. If iso_rr_path leads
to a directory then all regular files underneath will get the weight_number.
@*
The weight_number may range from -2147483648 to 2147483647.
The higher it is, the lower will be the block address of the file data
in the emerging ISO image.
Currently the El Torito boot catalog has a hardcoded weight of 1 billion.
Normally it should occupy the block with the lowest possible address.
Data files get added or loaded with initial weight 0. Boot image files
have a default weight of 2.
@c man .TP
@item @minus{}@minus{}sort-weight-list disk_path
@kindex @minus{}@minus{}sort-weight-list   set block address sorting weight
@cindex Block address, set sorting weight, @minus{}@minus{}sort-weight-list
Read pairs of weight number and iso_rr_path from a file of the
local filesystem. Apply each pair like with @minus{}@minus{}sort-weight.
@*
Only the last @minus{}@minus{}sort-weight-list or
@minus{}@minus{}sort-weight-patterns of a xorrisofs run gets into effect. 
@*
The weight number is read from the start of the line.
The iso_rr_path part of an input line begins immediately after the first blank
or tab character of the line.
@*
Notes for the case that this feature is used within a sequence of generic
xorriso commands (not an issue with a pure mkisofs emulation run):
@*
The addressed files must already be in the ISO image model when you execute
@*
  -as mkisofs @minus{}@minus{}sort-weight-list disk_path @minus{}@minus{}
@*
Several such commands may be used to apply more than one weight file.
@*
Data files which are loaded by -indev or -dev get a weight between 1 and
2 exp 28 = 268,435,456, depending on their block address. This shall keep
them roughly in the same order if the write method of modifying is applied.
@c man .TP
@item @minus{}@minus{}sort-weight-patterns disk_path
@kindex @minus{}@minus{}sort-weight-patterns   set block address sorting weight
@cindex Block address, set sorting weight, @minus{}@minus{}sort-weight-patterns
Like @minus{}@minus{}sort-weight-list , but expanding the iso_rr_paths as
shell parser patterns and applying @minus{}@minus{}sort-weight to each
matching file.
@c man .TP
@item -uid number|name
@kindex -uid   ownership for all files
@cindex Ownership, for all files, -uid
Use the given number or locally existing user name as owner id of all files

The standard ECMA-119 demands that no path in the image shall have more
than 8 name components or 255 characters. Therefore it would be necessary
to move deeper directory trees to a higher directory. Rock Ridge offers an
opportunity to let these relocated directories appear at their original
deep position, but this feature might not be implemented properly by
operating systems which mount the image.
@*
Option -D disables this deep directory relocation, and thus violates
ISO 9660 specs.

the options -rr_reloc_dir and -hide-rr-moved.

of more than 8 name components or 255 characters. Directories which lead to
such file paths will get moved to a directory in the root directory of the
image. Its name gets set by this option.
It is permissible to use the root directory itself.
@*
The overall directory tree will appear originally deep when interpreted as
Rock Ridge tree. It will appear as re-arranged if only ECMA-119 information
is considered.
@*
If the given relocation target directory does not already exist when image
production begins, then it will get created and marked for Rock Ridge as
relocation artefact. At least on GNU/Linux it will not be displayed in
mounted Rock Ridge images.

@*
If you later restore a backup with xattr from non-user namespaces, then make

single data file in the image. xorriso can check the content of an ISO
image with these sums and raise alert on mismatch.
See man xorriso, options -check_media, check_md5_r.

Search for families of iso_rr files which stem from the same disk file,
have identical content filtering and have identical properties.
The members of each family get the same inode number in the ISO image.
@*
Whether these numbers are respected at mount time depends on the operating

If disk_path is not an empty string, then append a scdbackup checksum record
to the end of this file. record_name is a word that gets part of tag

@c man .TP
@item -joliet-utf16
@kindex -joliet-utf16   use UTF-16 with Joliet names
@cindex UTF-16, for Joliet paths, -joliet-utf16
Encode Joliet file names in UTF-16BE rather than UCS-2.
The difference is with characters which are not present
in UCS-2 and get encoded in UTF-16 by 2 words of 16 bit each.
Both words then stem from a reserved subset of UCS-2.
@c man .TP
@item -hfsplus
@kindex -hfsplus   enable production of HFS+ partition
@cindex HFS+, enables production
Enable the production of an additional HFS+ filesystem inside the ISO 9660
image and mark it by Apple Partition Map (APM) entries in the System Area,
the first 32 KiB of the image.
@*
This may collide with options like -G or -isohybrid-mbr which submit user data
for inclusion in the same address range.
The first 8 bytes of the System Area get overwritten by
@{ 0x45, 0x52, 0x08 0x00, 0xeb, 0x02, 0xff, 0xff @}
which can be executed as x86 machine code without negative effects.
So if an MBR gets combined with this feature, then its first 8 bytes
should contain no essential commands.
@*
The next blocks of 2 KiB in the System Area will be occupied by APM entries.
The first one covers the part of the ISO image before the HFS+ filesystem
metadata. The second one marks the range from HFS+ metadata to the end
of file content data. If more ISO image data follow, then a third partition
entry gets produced. Other features of xorriso might cause the need for
more APM entries.
@*
Be aware that HFS+ is case-insensitive although it can record file names
with upper-case and lower-case letters. Therefore, file names from the iso_rr
name tree may collide in the HFS+ name tree. In this case they get changed
by adding underscore characters and counting numbers. In case of very long
names, it might be necessary to map them to "MANGLED_...".

"ppc_bootdir", "intel_bootfile", "show_folder", "os9_folder", "osx_folder".
@*
They may be abbreviated as "p", "i", "s", "9", and "x".
@*

@*
This works only if there is at least one data file underneath the directory.
disk_path can become ambiguous if files from different local filesystem
sub-trees are put into the same sub-tree of the ISO image.
Consider to use -hfs-bless-by "p" for unambiguous addressing via iso_rr_path.

records.
Permissible are up to 37 characters.
@c man .TP
@item -copyright iso_path

@item @minus{}@minus{}modification-date=YYYYMMDDhhmmsscc
@kindex @minus{}@minus{}modification-date   set ISO image timestamps
@cindex ISO image, set timestamps, @minus{}@minus{}modification-date=
Set a timestring that overrides ISO image creation and modification timestamps
literally.
It must consist of 16 decimal digits which form YYYYMMDDhhmmsscc, with
YYYY between 1970 and 2999. Time zone is GMT.
It is supposed to match this GRUB line:

@item @minus{}@minus{}application_use character|0xXY|disk_path
@kindex @minus{}@minus{}application_use  set Application Use field
@cindex ISO image, set Application Use field, @minus{}@minus{}application_use
Specify the content of the Application Use field which can take at most
512 bytes.
@*
If the parameter of this command is empty, then the field is filled
with 512 0-bytes. If it is a single character, then it gets repeated 512 times.
If it begins by "0x" followed by two hex digits [0-9a-fA-F], then the digits
are read as byte value which gets repeated 512 times.
@*
Any other parameter text is used as disk_path to open a data file and to
read up to 512 bytes from it. If the file is smaller than 512 bytes, then the
remaining bytes in the field get set to binary 0.

@c man .B El Torito Bootable ISO images:
@node Bootable, SystemArea, ImageId, Options
@section El Torito Bootable ISO images
@c man .PP
The precondition for a bootable ISO image is to have in the ISO image
the files of a boot loader. The boot facilities of computers get
directed to such files, which usually execute further program files
from the ISO image.
@command{xorrisofs} can produce several kinds of boot block or boot record,
which become part of the ISO image, and get interpreted by the according
boot facility.
@*
@c man .PP
@sp 1
@cindex El Torito, _definition
An @strong{El Torito}
boot record points the bootstrapping facility to a boot catalog
with one or more boot images, which are binary program files stored in
the ISO image.
The content of the boot image files is not in the scope of El Torito.
@*
xorriso composes the boot catalog according to the boot image
files given and structured by options -b, -e, -eltorito-alt-boot,
and @minus{}@minus{}efi-boot. Often it contains only one entry.
@*
Normally the boot images are data files inside the ISO filesystem. By
special path "--interval:appended_partition_NNN:all::" it is possible to
refer to an appended partition. The number NNN gives the partition number
as used with the corresponding option -append_partition.
E.g.:
@*
  -append_partition 2 0xef /tmp/efi.img
@*
  -e --interval:appended_partition_2:all::
@*
El Torito gets interpreted by boot facilities PC-BIOS and EFI.
Most bootable GNU/Linux CDs are equipped with ISOLINUX or GRUB boot images
for PC-BIOS.
@*
@command{xorrisofs} supports the example options out of the ISOLINUX wiki,
the options used in GRUB script grub-mkrescue, and the example in the
FreeBSD AvgLiveCD wiki.

@item -eltorito-platform "x86"|"PPC"|"Mac"|"efi"|0xnn|nnn
@kindex -eltorito-platform   El Torito Platform Id
@cindex Bootability, control, -eltorito-platform
Set the Platform Id number for the next option -b or -eltorito-boot.
The number may be chosen by a platform name or by a number between
0 and 255 (0x00 and 0xFF). "x86" = 0 is for PC-BIOS,
"PPC" = 1 for some PowerPC systems, "Mac" = 2 for some MacIntosh systems,
"efi" = 0xEF for EFI on modern PCs with x86 compatible CPUs or others.

@cindex Bootability, boot image load size, -boot-load-size
Set the number of 512-byte blocks to be loaded at boot time
from the boot image in the current catalog entry.
@*
Non-emulating BIOS bootimages usually need a load size of 4.
Nevertheless the default setting of mkisofs is to use the full size of the
boot image rounded up to a multiple of 4 512-byte blocks. This default
may be explicitly enforced by the word "full" instead of a number.
@*
EFI boot images usually get set the number of blocks occupied
by the boot image file.

@cindex Bootability, El Torito section id string, -eltorito-id
Define the ID string of the boot catalog
section where the boot image will be listed. If the value consists of 56
characters [0-9A-Fa-f] then it is converted into 28 bytes, else the first
28 characters become the ID string.
The ID string of the first boot image becomes the overall catalog ID.
It is limited to 24 characters. Other id_strings become section IDs.
@c man .TP

The first 16 blocks of an ISO image are the System Area.
It is reserved for system dependent boot software. This may be the
boot facilities and partition tables of various hardware architectures.
@*
@cindex MBR, _definition
A @strong{MBR} (Master Boot Record) contains boot code and a partition table.
It is read by PC-BIOS when booting from USB stick or hard disk,
and by PowerPC CHRP or PReP when booting.
An MBR partition with type 0xee indicates the presence of GPT.
@*
@cindex GPT, _definition
A @strong{GPT} (GUID Partition Table) marks partitions in a more modern way.
It is read by EFI when booting from USB stick or hard disk, and may be used
for finding and mounting a HFS+ partition inside the ISO image.
@*
@cindex APM, _definition
An @strong{APM} (Apple Partition Map) marks the HFS+ partition.
It is read by Macs for booting and for mounting.
@*
MBR, GPT and APM are combinable. APM occupies the first 8 bytes of
MBR boot code. All three do not hamper El Torito booting from CDROM.
@*
@command{xorrisofs} supports further boot facilities:
MIPS Big Endian (SGI), MIPS Little Endian (DEC), SUN SPARC, HP-PA, DEC Alpha.
Those are mutually not combinable and also not combinable with MBR, GPT,

@cindex Interval reader for system area and partitions
Several of the following options expect disk paths as input but also accept
description strings for the libisofs interval reader, which is able to cut
out data from disk files or -indev and to zeroize parts of the content:
-G, -generic-boot, @minus{}@minus{}embedded-boot, @minus{}@minus{}grub2-mbr,
-isohybrid-mbr, -efi-boot-part, -prep-boot-part, -B, -sparc-boot,
-append_partition.
@*
The description string consists
of the following components, separated by colon ':'
@*
  "@minus{}@minus{}interval:"Flags":"Interval":"Zeroizers":"Source
@*
The component "@minus{}@minus{}interval" states that this is not
a plain disk path but rather a interval reader description string.
@*
The component Flags modifies the further interpretation:
@*
"local_fs" demands to read from a file depicted by the path in Source.
@*
"imported_iso" demands to read from the -indev. This works only if -outdev
is not the same as -indev. The Source component is ignored.
@*
"appended_partition_NNN" with a decimal number NNN works only for options
which announce El Torito boot image paths: -b, -e, --efi-boot. The number gives
the partition number as used with the corresponding option -append_partition.
@*
The component Interval consists of two byte address numbers separated  by a "-" character. E.g. "0-429" means to read bytes 0 to 429.
@*
The component Zeroizers consists of zero or more comma separated strings.
They define which part of the read data to zeroize. Byte number 0 means
the byte read from the Interval start address.
Each string may be one of:
@*
"zero_mbrpt" demands to zeroize the MBR partition table if
bytes 510 and 511 bear the MBR signature 0x55 0xaa.
@*
"zero_gpt" demands to check for a GPT header in bytes 512 to 1023,
to zeroize it and its partition table blocks.
@*
"zero_apm" demands to check for an APM block 0 and to zeroize
its partition table blocks.
@*
Start_byte"-"End_byte demands to zeroize the read-in bytes beginning
with number Start_byte and ending after End_byte.
@*
The component Source is the file path with flag "local_fs", and ignored with
flag "imported_iso".
@*
Byte numbers may be scaled by a suffix out of @{k,m,g,t,s,d@} meaning
multiplication by @{1024, 1024k, 1024m, 1024g, 2048, 512@}. A scaled value
end number depicts the last byte of the scaled range.
@*
E.g. "0d-0d" is "0-511".
@*
Examples:
@*
  "local_fs:0-32767:zero_mbrpt,zero_gpt,440-443:/tmp/template.iso"

given by option -b bootable from USB sticks and hard disks via PC-BIOS.
This preparation is normally done by ISOLINUX program isohybrid
on the already produced ISO image.
@*
The disk path should lead to one of the Syslinux files isohdp[fp]x*.bin .
The MBR gets patched according to isohybrid needs. The first partition
describes the range of the ISO image. Its start is at block 0 by default,

partition of type Basic Data. This works only with -isohybrid-mbr and
has the same impact on the system area as -efi-boot-part. It cannot be
combined with -efi-boot-part or -hfsplus.
@*
The first three boot images which are marked by GPT will also show up
as partition entries of type 0xef in MBR.

of the MBR partition which represents the ISO or at least protects it.
Number may be 0x00 to 0xff. The text "default" re-enables the default types
of the various occasions to create an ISO MBR partition.
@*
This is without effect if no such partition emerges by other settings or
if the partition type is prescribed mandatorily like 0xee for GPT protective
MBR or 0x96 for CHRP.

@kindex @minus{}@minus{}mbr-force-bootable   Enforce MBR bootable/active flag
@cindex Bootability, bootable MBR partition, @minus{}@minus{}mbr-force-bootable
Enforce an MBR partition with "bootable/active" flag if options like
@minus{}@minus{}protective-msdos-label or @minus{}@minus{}grub2-mbr are given.
These options normally cause the flag to be set if there is an
MBR partition of type other than 0xee or 0xef.
If no such partition exists, then no bootflag is set, unless
@minus{}@minus{}mbr-force-bootable forces creation of a dummy partition
of type 0x00 which covers only the first block of the ISO image.
@*
If no bootable MBR is indicated by other options and a partition gets created
by -append_partition, then @minus{}@minus{}mbr-force-bootable causes a
bootflag like it would do with e.g. @minus{}@minus{}protective-msdos-label.
@c man .TP
@item -partition_offset 2kb_block_adr
@kindex -partition_offset   Make mountable by partition 1
@cindex Mountability, by non-trivial partition 1, -partition_offset
Cause a partition table with a single partition that begins at the
given block address. This is counted in 2048 byte
blocks, not in 512 byte blocks. If the block address is non-zero then it must
be at least 16. Values larger than 16 are hardly of use.
A non-zero partition offset causes two superblocks to be
generated and two sets of directory trees. The image is then mountable from its
absolute start as well as from the partition start.
@*
The offset value of an ISO image gets preserved when a new session is added
to a loaded image.
So the value defined here is only in effect if a new ISO image gets written.
@c man .TP
@item -partition_hd_cyl number
@kindex -partition_hd_cyl   MBR heads per cylinder
@cindex MBR, sectors per head, -partition_sec_hd
Set the number of heads per cylinder for the MBR partition table.

@c man .TP
@item -partition_sec_hd number
@kindex -partition_sec_hd   MBR sectors per head
@cindex MBR, sectors per head, -partition_sec_hd
Set the number of sectors per head for the MBR partition table.
0 chooses a default value. Maximum is 63.
@*
The product partition_sec_hd * partition_hd_cyl * 512 is the cylinder size.
It should be divisible by 2048 in order to make exact alignment possible.
With appended partitions and -appended_part_as_gpt there is no limit for
the number of cylinders. Else there may be at most 1024 of them.
If the cylinder size is too small to stay below the limit,
then appropriate values of partition_hd_cyl are chosen with 
partition_sec_hd 32 or 63. If the image is larger than 8,422,686,720 bytes,
then the cylinder size constraints cannot be fulfilled for MBR.
They seem not overly important anyway.
Flat block addresses in partition tables are good for 1 TiB.
@c man .TP
@item -partition_cyl_align mode
@kindex -partition_cyl_align   Image size alignment
@cindex Image size, alignment, -partition_cyl_align
Control image size alignment to an integer number of cylinders.
It is prescribed by isohybrid specs and it seems to please program fdisk.
Cylinder size must be divisible by 2048.
Images larger than 8,323,596,288 bytes cannot be aligned in MBR partition
table.
@*
Mode "auto" is default. Alignment by padding happens only if
option -isohybrid-mbr is given.
@*
Mode "on" causes alignment by padding with option
@minus{}@minus{}protective-msdos-label too.
Mode "all" is like "on" but also pads up partitions from -append_partition 
to an aligned size.
@*
Mode "off" disables alignment unconditionally.
@c man .TP
@item -append_partition partition_number type_code disk_path
@kindex -append_partition   Append MBR or GPT partition after image
@cindex MBR, GPT, append partition, -append_partition
Cause a prepared filesystem image to be appended to the ISO image and to be
described by a partition table entry in a boot block at the start of the
emerging ISO image. The partition entry will bear the size of the submitted
file rounded up to the next multiple of 2048 bytes or to the next multiple
of the cylinder size.
@*
Beware of subsequent multi-session runs. The appended partition will get
overwritten.
@*
partition_number may be 1 to 4. Number 1 will put the whole ISO image into
the unclaimed space before partition 1. So together with most xorriso MBR
or GPT features, number 2 would be the most natural choice.
@*
The type_code may be "FAT12", "FAT16", "Linux",
or a hexadecimal number between 0x00 and 0xff. Not all those numbers will
yield usable results. For a list of codes search the Internet for
"Partition Types" or run fdisk command "L".
This code matters only with MBR, not with GPT.
@*
If some other command causes the production of GPT, then the appended
partitions will be mentioned there too, even if not -appended_part_as_gpt
is given.
@c man .TP
@item -appended_part_as_gpt
@kindex -appended_part_as_gpt   Appended partitions in GPT
@cindex GPT, mark appended partitions, -appended_part_as_gpt
Marks partitions from -append_partition in GPT rather than in MBR.
In this case the MBR shows a single partition
of type 0xee which covers the whole output data.
@*
By default, appended partitions get marked in GPT only if GPT is produced
because of other options.
@c man .TP
@item -appended_part_as_apm
@kindex -appended_part_as_apm   Appended partitions in APM
@cindex APM, mark appended partitions, -appended_part_as_apm

because of other options and -part_like_isohybrid is enabled.
@c man .TP
@item -efi-boot-part disk_path
@kindex -efi-boot-part   EFI boot partition
@cindex Bootability, for EFI, -efi-boot-part
Copy a file from disk into the emerging ISO image and mark it by a GPT entry as
EFI System Partition. EFI boot firmware is supposed to use a FAT filesystem
image in such a partition for booting from USB stick or hard disk.
@*
Instead of a disk_path, the word @minus{}@minus{}efi-boot-image may be given.
It exposes in GPT the content of the first El Torito EFI boot image as

@item @minus{}@minus{}gpt_disk_guid value
@kindex  @minus{}@minus{}gpt_disk_guid   GPT GUID
@cindex Disk GUID, for GPT, @minus{}@minus{}gpt_disk_guid
Control whether an emerging GPT shall get a randomly generated disk GUID
or whether the GUID is supplied by the user.
Value "random" is default. Value "modification-date" produces a low quality
GUID from the value set by option @minus{}@minus{}modification-date=.
@*
A string of 32 hex digits, or a RFC 4122 compliant GUID string may be used to
set the disk GUID directly. UEFI prescribes the first three components of 
a RFC 4122 GUID string to be byte-swapped in the binary representation:
@*
E.g. @minus{}@minus{}gpt_disk_guid 2303cd2a-73c7-424a-a298-25632da7f446
equals @minus{}@minus{}gpt_disk_guid 2acd0323c7734a42a29825632da7f446
@*
The partition GUIDs get generated by minimally varying the disk GUID.

@cindex Bootability, for CHRP, -chrp-boot-part
Mark the block range of the whole emerging ISO image as MBR partition of type
0x96. This is not compatible with any other feature that produces MBR
partition entries. It makes GPT unrecognizable.
@*
CHRP is often used in conjunction with HFS. It is not yet tested whether HFS+
filesystems produced with option -hfsplus would boot on any
CHRP capable machine which does not boot pure ISO 9660 as well.
@c man .TP

@c man .TP
@item -prep-boot-part disk_path
@kindex -prep-boot-part   PReP partition
@cindex Bootability, for PReP, -prep-boot-part
Copy a file from disk into the emerging ISO image and mark it by a MBR
partition entry of type 0x41. PReP boot firmware is supposed to read
the content of the partition as single ELF executable file.
This option is compatible with other MBR partitions and with GPT.
@c man .TP
@item -mips-boot iso_rr_path
@kindex -mips-boot   MIPS Big Endian boot image
@cindex Bootability, control, -mips-boot
Declare a data file in the image to be a

Header. This is mutually exclusive with production of other boot blocks
like MBR.
It will overwrite the first 512 bytes of any data provided by -G.
Up to 15 boot files can be declared by multiple -mips-boot options. 
@c man .TP
@item -mipsel-boot iso_rr_path

Only a single boot file can be declared by -mipsel-boot.
@c man .TP
@item -B disk_path[,disk_path ...]
@kindex -B   SUN SPARC boot images
@cindex Bootability, control, -B, -sparc-boot
Cause one or more data files on disk to be written after the end of the
ISO image. A SUN Disk Label will be written into the first 512 bytes of the
ISO image which lists this image as partition 1 and the given disk_paths as
partition 2 up to 8.
@*
The disk files should contain suitable boot images for SUN SPARC systems.
@*
The pseudo disk_path "..." causes that all empty partition entries become
copies of the last non-empty entry. If no other disk_path is given before
"..." then all partitions describe the ISO image. In this case, the boot
loader code has to be imported by option -G.

From man genisoimage:
"Jigdo is a tool to help in the distribution of large files like CD and
DVD images; see http://atterer.net/jigdo/ for more details. Debian CDs
and DVD ISO images are published on the web in jigdo format to allow
end users to download them more efficiently."
@*
If the use of libjte was enabled at compile time of xorriso, then
@command{xorrisofs} can produce a .jigdo and a .template file together with a
single-session ISO image. If not, then Jigdo options will cause a
FAILURE event, which normally leads to program abort.
@*
One may determine the ability for Jigdo by:
@*
@sp 1
  $ xorrisofs -version 2>&1 | grep '^libjte' && echo YES 
@*
@sp 1
@c man .PP
The .jigdo file contains checksums and symbolic file addresses.
The .template file contains the compressed ISO image with reference tags
instead of the content bytes of the listed files.
@*
Input for this process are the normal arguments for a @command{xorrisofs}
session
with no image loaded, and a .md5 file which lists those data files which may be
listed in the .jigdo file and externally referenced in the .template file.
Each designated file is represented in the .md5 file by a single text line:
@*
MD5 as 32 hex digits, 2 blanks, size as 12 decimal digits or blanks, 2 blanks,
symbolic file address
@*
The file address in an .md5 line has to bear the same basename as the
disk_path of the file which it shall match. The directory path of
the file address is decisive for To=From mapping, not for file recognition.
After To=From mapping, the file address gets written into the .jigdo
file. Jigdo restore tools will convert these addresses into really
reachable data source addresses from which they can read.
@*
If the list of jigdo parameters is not empty, then padding will be
counted as part of the ISO image.

@section Set ISO image paths by -graft-points
Without option -graft-points each given disk file is copied into the root
directory of the ISO image, maintaining its name. If a directory is given,
then its files and sub-directories are copied into the root directory,
maintaining their names.
@*
@sp 1
  $ xorrisofs ... /home/me/datafile /tmp/directory
@*
@sp 1
yields in the ISO image root directory:
@*

  /datafile
@*
  /file_1_from_directory
@*
  ...
@*
  /file_N_from_directory
@*
@sp 1

With option -graft-points it is possible to put files and directories to
arbitrary paths in the ISO image.
@*
@sp 1
  $ xorrisofs ... -graft-points /home/me/datafile /dir=/tmp/directory
@*
@sp 1
yields in the ISO image root directory:
@*
@sp 1
  /datafile
@*
  /dir
@*
@sp 1
Eventually needed parent directories in
the image will be created automatically:
@*
@sp 1
  /datafiles/file1=/home/me/datafile
@*
@sp 1
yields in the ISO image:
@sp 1

@c man .B Perform multi-session runs
@node ExMkisofs, ExGrowisofs, ExGraft, Examples
@section Perform multi-session runs
This example works for multi-session media only:
CD-R[W], DVD-R[W], DVD+R, BD-R.
Add cdrskin option @minus{}@minus{}grow_overwriteable_iso
to all -as cdrecord runs
in order to enable multi-session emulation on overwriteable media.
@*
The first session is written like this:
@*
@sp 1
  $ xorrisofs -graft-points \
@*
              /tree1=prepared_for_iso/tree1 \
@*
    | xorriso -as cdrecord -v dev=/dev/sr0 blank=fast -multi -eject - 
@*
@sp 1
Follow-up sessions are written like this:
@*
@sp 1
  $ dd if=/dev/sr0 count=1 >/dev/null 2>&1
@*
  $ m=$(xorriso -as cdrecord dev=/dev/sr0 -msinfo)
@*
  $ xorrisofs -M /dev/sr0 -C $m -graft-points \
@*
              /tree2=prepared_for_iso/tree2 \
@*
    | xorriso -as cdrecord -v dev=/dev/sr0 -waiti -multi -eject -
@*
@sp 1
Always eject the drive tray between sessions. The old sessions
get read via /dev/sr0. Its device driver might not be aware
of the changed content before it loads the medium again.
In this case the previous session would not be loaded and the
new session would contain only the newly added files.
@*
For the same reason do not let xorriso -as cdrecord load the medium,
but rather do this manually or by a program that reads from /dev/sr0.
@c man .SS
@c man .B Let xorrisofs work underneath growisofs
@node ExGrowisofs, ExIncBackup, ExMkisofs, Examples
@section Let xorriso work underneath growisofs
growisofs expects an ISO formatter program which understands options -C and
-M. A variable is defined to override the hardcoded default name.
@*
@sp 1
  $ export MKISOFS="xorrisofs"
@*
  $ growisofs -Z /dev/dvd /some/files
@*
  $ growisofs -M /dev/dvd /more/files
@*
@sp 1
If no "xorrisofs" is available on your system, then you will have to create
a link pointing to the xorriso binary and tell growisofs to use it. E.g. by:
@*
@sp 1
  $ ln -s $(which xorriso) "$HOME/xorrisofs"
@*
  $ export MKISOFS="$HOME/xorrisofs"
@*
@sp 1
One may quit mkisofs emulation by argument "@minus{}@minus{}" and make
use of all xorriso commands. growisofs dislikes options which
start with "-o" but -outdev must be set to "-".
So use "outdev" instead:
@*
@sp 1
  $ growisofs -Z /dev/dvd @minus{}@minus{}for_backup @minus{}@minus{} \
@*
              outdev - -update_r /my/files /files
@*
  $ growisofs -M /dev/dvd @minus{}@minus{}for_backup @minus{}@minus{} \
@*
              outdev - -update_r /my/files /files
@*
Note that @minus{}@minus{}for_backup is given in the mkisofs emulation.
To preserve the recorded extra data it must already be in effect, when
the emulation loads the image.
@c man .SS
@c man .B Incremental backup of a few directory trees
@node ExIncBackup, ExIncBckAcc, ExGrowisofs, Examples
@section Incremental backup of a few directory trees
This changes the directory trees /open_source_project and /personal_mail
in the ISO image so that they become exact copies of their disk counterparts.
ISO file objects get created, deleted or get their attributes adjusted
accordingly.
@*
ACL, xattr, hard links and MD5 checksums will be recorded.
It is expected that inode numbers in the disk filesystem are persistent
over cycles of mounting and booting.
Files with names matching *.o or *.swp get excluded explicitly.

@strong{Better do not use your youngest backup for -old-root}.
Have at least two media which you use alternatingly. So only older backups
get endangered by the new write operation, while the newest backup is
stored safely on a different medium.
@*
Always have a blank medium ready to perform a full backup in case the update
attempt fails due to insufficient remaining capacity. This failure will
not spoil the old medium, of course.
@*
@sp 1
@c man .sp 1
If inode numbers on disk are not persistent, then use
option @minus{}@minus{}old-root-no-ino .
In this case an update run will compare recorded MD5
sums against the current file content on hard disk.
@*
@sp 1
@c man .sp 1
With @strong{mount} option @strong{-o "sbsector="} on GNU/Linux
or @strong{-s} on FreeBSD or NetBSD
it is possible to access the session trees which represent the older backup
versions. With CD media, GNU/Linux mount accepts session numbers directly by
its option "session=".
@*
Multi-session media and most overwriteable media written by xorriso can tell
the sbsectors of their sessions by xorriso option -toc:
@*
@sp 1
  $ xorriso -dev /dev/sr0 -toc
@*
@sp 1
xorriso can print the matching mount command for a session number:
@*
@sp 1
  $ xorriso -mount_cmd /dev/sr0 session 12 /mnt
@*
@sp 1
or for a volume id that matches a search expression:
@*
@sp 1
  $ xorriso -mount_cmd /dev/sr0 volid '*2008_12_05*' /mnt
@*
@sp 1
Both yield on standard output something like:

@section Incremental backup with accumulated trees
Solaris does not offer the option to mount older sessions.
In order to keep them accessible, one may map all files to a file tree under
a session directory and accumulate those directories from session to session.
The -root tree is cloned from the -old-root tree before it gets
compared with the appropriate trees on disk.
@*
This demands to know the previously used session directory name.
@*
With the first session:
@*
@sp 1
  $ xorrisofs -root /session1 \
@*
    -o - @minus{}@minus{}for_backup -m '*.o' -m '*.swp' \
@*
    -V PROJ_MAIL_"$(date '+%Y_%m_%d_%H%M%S')" -graft-points \
@*
    /projects=/home/thomas/projects \
@*
    /personal_mail=/home/thomas/personal_mail \
@*
    | xorriso -as cdrecord dev=/dev/sr0 -v blank=as_needed \
@*
              -multi -waiti -eject -
@*
@sp 1
@c man .sp 1
With the second session, option -old-root refers to /session1 and the
new -root is /session2.
@*
Do not let xorriso -as cdrecord load the medium,
but rather do this manually or by a program that reads from /dev/sr0.
@*
@sp 1
  $ dd if=/dev/sr0 count=1 >/dev/null 2>&1
@*
  $ msinfo=$(xorriso -as cdrecord dev=/dev/sr0 -msinfo)
@*
  $ load_opts=
@*
  $ test -n "$msinfo" && load_opts="-M /dev/sr0 -C $msinfo"
@*
  $ xorrisofs $load_opts -root /session2 -old-root /session1 \
@*
    -o - @minus{}@minus{}for_backup -m '*.o' -m '*.swp' \
@*
    -V PROJ_MAIL_"$(date '+%Y_%m_%d_%H%M%S')" -graft-points \
@*
    /projects=/home/thomas/projects \
@*
    /personal_mail=/home/thomas/personal_mail \
@*
    | xorriso -as cdrecord dev=/dev/sr0 -v -multi -waiti -eject -
@*
@sp 1
With the third session, option -old-root refers to /session2.
The new -root is /session3. And so on.

@c man .B Create bootable images for PC-BIOS and EFI
@node ExBootable, , ExIncBckAcc, Examples
@section Create bootable images for PC-BIOS and EFI
The SYSLINUX/ISOLINUX boot loader suite is popular for booting PC-BIOS.
The ISOLINUX wiki prescribes to create on disk a directory ./CD_root and
to copy all desired files underneath that directory. Especially file
isolinux.bin shall be copied to ./CD_root/isolinux/isolinux.bin .
This is the boot image file.
@*
The prescribed mkisofs options can be used unchanged with @command{xorrisofs}:
@*
@sp 1
  $ xorrisofs -o output.iso \
@*
      -b isolinux/isolinux.bin -c isolinux/boot.cat \
@*
      -no-emul-boot -boot-load-size 4 -boot-info-table \
@*
      ./CD_root
@*
@sp 1
Put it on CD by a burn program. E.g.:
@*
@sp 1
  $ xorriso -as cdrecord -v dev=/dev/sr0 blank=as_needed output.iso
@*
@sp 1
@c man .sp 1
The image from above example will boot from CD, DVD or BD, but not from
USB stick or other hard-disk-like devices. This can be done by help of an
isohybrid MBR. Syslinux provides matching template files
as isohdp[fp]x*.bin . E.g. /usr/lib/syslinux/isohdpfx.bin .
@*
If a few hundred KB of size do not matter, then option -partition_offset
can be used to create a partition table where partition 1 starts not
at block 0. This facilitates later manipulations of the USB stick by
tools for partitioning and formatting.
@*
The image from the following example will be prepared for booting via MBR
and its first partition will start at hard disk block 64.
@*
It will also boot from optical media.
@*
@sp 1
  $ xorrisofs -o output.iso \
@*
      -b isolinux/isolinux.bin -c isolinux/boot.cat \
@*
      -no-emul-boot -boot-load-size 4 -boot-info-table \
@*
      -isohybrid-mbr /usr/lib/syslinux/isohdpfx.bin \
@*
      -partition_offset 16 \
@*
      ./CD_root
@*
@sp 1
Become superuser and copy the image to the unpartitioned base device file
of the USB stick. On GNU/Linux this is e.g. /dev/sdb, not /dev/sdb1.
@*
CAUTION:
This will overwrite any partitioning on the USB stick and make
remaining data unaccessible.
@*
So first make sure you got the correct address of the intended device.
E.g. by reading 100 MiB data from it and watching it blinking:
@*
@sp 1
  # dd bs=2K if=/dev/sdb count=50K >/dev/null
@*
@sp 1
Now copy the image onto it
@*
@sp 1
  # dd bs=2K if=output.iso of=/dev/sdb
@*
@sp 1
@c man .sp 1
Now for EFI:
@*
The boot image file has to be the image of an EFI System Partition,
i.e. a FAT filesystem with directory /EFI/BOOT and boot files with
EFI prescribed names: BOOTIA32.EFI for 32 bit x86,
BOOTx64.EFI for 64 bit AMD/x86 (in UEFI-2.4 there is indeed a lower case "x"),
BOOTAA64.EFI for 64 bit ARM. The software in the FAT filesystem should be
able to find and inspect the ISO filesystem for boot loader configuration and
start of operating system. GRUB2 program grub-mkimage can produce such a
FAT filesystem with suitable content, which then uses further GRUB2
software from the ISO filesystem.
@*
EFI boot equipment may be combined with above ISOLINUX isohybrid for PC-BIOS
in a not really UEFI-2.4 compliant way, which obviously works well. It yields
MBR and GPT partition tables, both with nested partitions.
Assumed the EFI System Partition image is ready as ./CD_root/boot/grub/efi.img,
add the following options before the directory address ./CD_root:
@*
@sp 1
      -eltorito-alt-boot -e 'boot/grub/efi.img' -no-emul-boot \
@*
      -isohybrid-gpt-basdat \
@*
@sp 1
More compliant with UEFI-2.4 is to decide for either MBR or GPT and to
append a copy of the EFI System Partition in order to avoid overlap of
ISO partition and EFI partition. Here for MBR:
@*
@sp 1
      -eltorito-alt-boot -e 'boot/grub/efi.img' -no-emul-boot \
      -append_partition 2 0xef ./CD_root/boot/grub/efi.img \
@*
@sp 1
The resulting ISOs are supposed to boot from optical media and USB stick.
One may omit option -eltorito-alt-boot if no option -b is used to make
the ISO bootable via PC-BIOS.
@*
@sp 1
@c man .sp 1
For ISOs with pure GRUB2 boot equipment consider to use GRUB2 tool
grub-mkrescue as frontend to xorrisofs.
@*
@sp 1
@c man .sp 1
If you have a bootable ISO filesystem and want to know its equipment plus
a proposal how to reproduce it, try:
@*
@sp 1
  $ xorriso -hfsplus on -indev IMAGE.iso \
      -report_el_torito plain -report_system_area plain \
      -print "" -print "======= Proposal for xorrisofs options:" \
      -report_el_torito as_mkisofs

@c man .SH FILES
@node Files, Environ, Examples, Top 
@chapter Files
@c man .SS 
@c man .B Startup files:
@section Startup Files
@*
If not --no_rc is given as the first argument then @command{xorrisofs}
attempts on startup to read and execute lines from the following files:
@*
@sp 1
   /etc/default/xorriso
@*
   /etc/opt/xorriso/rc
@*
   /etc/xorriso/xorriso.conf
@*
   $HOME/.xorrisorc
@*
@sp 1
The files are read in the sequence given here, but none of them is required
to exist. The lines are not interpreted as @command{xorrisofs} options but
as generic xorriso commands. See man xorriso.
@c man .PP
After the xorriso startup files, the program tries one by one to open for
reading:
@*
@sp 1
   ./.mkisofsrc
@*
   $MKISOFSRC
@*
   $HOME/.mkisofsrc
@*
   $(dirname $0)/.mkisofsrc 
@*
@sp 1
On success it interprets the file content and does not try further files.
The last address is used only if start argument 0 has a non-trivial dirname.
@*
The reader currently interprets the following NAME=VALUE pairs:
@*
@sp 1
 APPI default for -A
@*
 PUBL default for -publisher
@*
 SYSI default for -sysid
@*
 VOLI default for -V
@*
 VOLS default for -volset
@*
@sp 1
Any other lines will be silently ignored.
@*
@sp 1
@c man .SH ENVIRONMENT
@node Environ, Seealso, Files, Top 
@chapter Environ
The following environment variables influence the program behavior:
@*
HOME is used to find xorriso and mkisofs startup files.
@*
MKISOFSRC may be used to point the program to a mkisofs startup file.
@*
SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH belongs to the specs of reproducible-builds.org.
It is supposed to be either undefined or to contain a decimal number
which tells the seconds since january 1st 1970. If it contains a number,
then it is used as time value to set the default of
@minus{}@minus{}modification-date=.
@minus{}@minus{}gpt_disk_guid defaults to "modification-date".
The default of @minus{}@minus{}set_all_file_dates is then "set_to_mtime".
@*
Startup files and program options can override the effect of SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH.
