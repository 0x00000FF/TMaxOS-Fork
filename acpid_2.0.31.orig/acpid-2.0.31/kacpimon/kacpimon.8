.SH NAME
kacpimon \- Kernel ACPI Event Monitor
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBkacpimon\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBkacpimon\fP is a monitor program that connects to three sources of ACPI 
events:
.IP
1. /proc/acpi/event
.br
2. netlink
.br
3. the input layer (/dev/input/event*)
.PP
\fBkacpimon\fP then reports on what it sees while it is connected.
.PP
Use \fBkacpimon\fP to make sure your kernel is sending acpi-related events
via the three sources mentioned above.
.PP
Since both
.BR acpid (8)
and \fBkacpimon\fP connect to the same sources, be sure to stop
.BR acpid (8)
before running kacpimon.  If you are using
.BR upstart (7),
use
.BR initctl (8)
to stop
.BR acpid (8).
If you are using
.BR systemd (1),
use
.BR systemctl (1)
to stop
.BR acpid (8).
If you aren't using either of those, you can try
.BR killall (1)
to stop
.BR acpid (8).
.PP
Be sure to run \fBkacpimon\fP as root or else it won't be able to open
/proc/acpi/event or the input layer:
.IP
sudo kacpimon
.PP  
If you want to pipe the output of \fBkacpimon\fP to a file, be sure to use
the "Esc" key to exit rather than Ctrl-C.  Using Ctrl-C will cause
output to be lost.
