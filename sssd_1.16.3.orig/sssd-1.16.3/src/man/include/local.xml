    <title>THE LOCAL DOMAIN</title>
    <para>
        In order to function correctly, a domain with
        <quote>id_provider=local</quote> must be created and the SSSD must
        be running.
    </para>
    <para>
        The administrator might want to use the SSSD local users instead
        of traditional UNIX users in cases where the group nesting (see
        <citerefentry>
            <refentrytitle>sss_groupadd</refentrytitle>
            <manvolnum>8</manvolnum>
        </citerefentry>) is needed. The local users are also useful for
        testing and development of the SSSD without having to deploy
        a full remote server. The <command>sss_user*</command> and
        <command>sss_group*</command> tools use a local LDB storage to
        store users and groups.
