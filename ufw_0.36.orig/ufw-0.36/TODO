TODO
----
DBus support so frontend can send messages to ufw which can then be protected
via policy kit

Provide a very simple GUI, possibly with NetworkManager integration. This GUI
would not replace gufw, which aims to expose the full functionality of ufw.

MAC address filtering (ie ebtables)

nftables backend (first create compatibility backend and transition upgrades
to that. When nftables backend is complete, new installs can use it)
